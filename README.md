# Windows-Form-Calculator
A Windows Form Calculator is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using the Windows Forms framework in a programming language like C#. 
It provides users with a user-friendly environment to perform basic to advanced mathematical operations. 
The calculator typically includes a standard set of numeric buttons, arithmetic operation buttons (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), 
and additional functionality like square root, exponentiation, and memory operations.
Users can input numbers using the graphical interface, and the calculator displays the input and results on the screen. 
The design often includes a clear button to reset the input, and a backspace button for correcting entries. 
The goal is to provide a simple yet powerful tool for performing various calculations efficiently within a Windows environment.
